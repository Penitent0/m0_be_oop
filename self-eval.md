# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

**This was a very challenging CFU. I had to step away from it and come back to it as well as engage with my small group for support. However, I felt much more comfortable seeking help when I was stuck and was able to quickly implement solutions.**

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

**I feel like I am taking adequate breaks and able to stay focused**

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?

**Scheduled self-care time to prepare meals/snacks ahead of intense lessons will really help. I also plan on taking more short walks throughout the day to help alleviate stress and reduce burnout.**
